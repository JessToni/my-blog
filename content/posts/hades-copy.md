## Introduction

In the name of Hades!

Back when we were kids, we used to dream about buying any video game we ever wanted and just play all of them to completion. You’re 27 now and you can do exactly that. And you did, with the monster rig to run it. Now you sit on the couch, start the game, and what do you know, it’s 11 pm and it’s time to sleep. You got the game but you ain’t got the time to play it gosh darn it!

As Gen Z’ers enter adulthood, we enter this weird purgatory of “I can afford this but I can’t necessarily enjoy this” phase in our life. Especially for us gamers, we no longer have the luxury of disappearing for WEEKS just playing video games. And with the gaming market saturated with games like Elden Ring that need extensive playing time to enjoy, multiplayer games with steep learning curves like Valorant, and gacha games like Genshin that love nothing more than to squeeze every penny out of your pocket for the latest player character that’s totally not just a reskin, it takes more and more out of us to enjoy gaming now that we’re adults.
