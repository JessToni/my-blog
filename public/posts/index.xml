      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we Gen Z’ers step into adulthood, we often find ourselves in a strange purgatory: “I can afford this, but I don’t have time to enjoy it.” This couldn’t be more true when it comes to video games. We grew up dreaming of the day we could buy any game we wanted, fire it up, and play it from start to finish. Fast forward to now. You’re 24 years old, sitting in front of a monster rig that can run anything, and you’ve got the game you’ve been eyeing for months. But what happens?
